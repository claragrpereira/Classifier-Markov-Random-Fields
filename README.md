# Classifier Markov Random Fields

This project was designed in an algorithms and computational modelling course. The goal was to learn a classifier and classify entities into categories , given a list of features.
Two applications were created: the first allows to choose a dataset and learns its stucture, while the second takes as input a list of features corresponding to 
an individual and returns the category to which it belongs.

This archive contains code in Java for a machine learning program based on Markov's random fields. It also contains possible datasets to test the program,
and the statement of the project (for theoretical explanations and stucture details). Both the comments in the code and the statement are written  in portuguese.
